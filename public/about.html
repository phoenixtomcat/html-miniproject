Over the past two years, I’ve honed my skills in Python programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering fundamentals. With experience in tools such as Jenkins, Git, GitHub, Linux, Jira, and Confluence, I am continuously advancing my expertise in DevOps and business analytics. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in areas like advanced Python, C++, SQL, and MS Excel to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech landscape.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical background, I have a deep interest in building real-world software solutions that are efficient and scalable. I take pride in my ability to approach challenges with a problem-solving mindset and turn complex issues into structured, quantifiable outcomes.
